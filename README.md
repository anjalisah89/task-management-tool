# Task Management Tool

This is a task management application that allows users to create, update, delete, and manage a list of tasks efficiently. The application was developed as an assignment for `The Alter Office` for the `Frontend Developer` position.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend & Database**: Firebase (for user authentication and data storage)
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Features

### User Authentication
- Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In.

### Task Management
- Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Task categorization (e.g., work, personal) and tagging for better organization.
- Allow users to set due dates for tasks.
- Users can sort tasks based on due dates.

### Batch Actions
- Perform batch actions on tasks (e.g., delete multiple tasks, mark multiple tasks as complete).

### Task History and Activity Log
- Track changes made to tasks (e.g., creation, edits, deletions) and display an activity log for each task.

### Filter Options
- Filter tasks by tags, category, and date range.
- Enable search functionality by task title.

### Board/List View
- Users can switch between a board view (Kanban-style) and a list view for their tasks.

### Responsive Design
- Fully responsive application, adapting to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) with a mobile-first design approach.
